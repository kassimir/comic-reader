# Comic Reader

This is an Electron-based program to read comic books from http://readcomiconline.to. Keep in mind they are no way affiliated with this, but I don't feel bad about scraping data from a pirating web site. 

**NOTE: I spend a LOT of money on comics (I bought over 700 last year). I then read them through the website. Also, if I bought all the comics I read on this site, I would be poor, and I have a family to provide for**

That being said, I've actually picked up books that I normally never would have bought, simply because I read them for free and decided to add them to my collection.

Bug!
0) X-Men: Endangered Species TPB (Part 1): that combo needs added to the issues list!

List of things to complete (in no particular order):

0) Shareable link / ability to open from link
0) Error handling for things like no internet or for the preloads not returning anything in a timely fashion
0) Allow for saving search results
0) Update search functions to not have to get information if the link is clicked again while the information already exists
